title     :  packer setup

## Design / Proposal / Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create `variables.pkr.hcl` : This file contains all variables:
  - Variables must have type decleration.
  - Variables must have a description.
  - When possible, include `validation` blocks.
  - use `sensitive` keyword for secrets.
  - `Locals` are defined only in this file
- [ ] Create `sources.pkr.hcl`: This file contains `source` definition for building an image on Azure
  - Ensure secret values are not included in the source code. Create a `.env`
  script that reads secrets from [Azure Key Vault][azure-key-vault] and set environment variables;
  those environment variables are used to pass in secrets to packer. Refer to
  [Additional context](#additional-context) section for an example
  - Use GMF hardened base image sku
  - Include brief synopsis of what is going on as comment above `source` stanza
- [ ] Create `build.pkr.hcl`: This file containes `build` stanza that uses the source defined in `sources.pkr.hcl`.
  - At this point, there is no need to include any provisioners
  - Include brief synopsis of what is going on as comment above `build` stanza

## Additional context

- Assume the following is out secret variable definition

```hcl
variable "client_secret" {
  type        = string
  sensitive   = true
  description = <<EOT
  client secret value.
  EOT
}
```

- Create a `.env` file that sets secret environment variables. We assume we already know the Azure key-vault Key ID associated with entry holding our secret:

```bash
export PKR_VAR_client_secret="$(az keyvault secret show --id "<TARGET-SECRET-ID>" --query "value" --output tsv)"
```

- Source the `.env` file so that `client_secret` variable gets set in your current shell

```bash
source ".env"
```

- At this point , Packer knows the value of `client_secret` since it will read it from `PKR_VAR_client_secret`.

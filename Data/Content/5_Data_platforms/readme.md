# Data Platforms

As everything in technology, data projects and tools are also in a constant improvement.

Some years ago we had only on-prem projects, old and few technologies, etc. Then we started with cloud and projects to migrate 
on-prem to cloud. And, in the same way, working from single-cloud to multi-cloud projects. 

And it's not only cloud. For example, programming languages, now we have the option to process data with OOP and FP instead of 
just long and boring SQL scripts. 

All of this progress is fast. And if some time we needed people to manage a physical cluster, manually install and configure spark, etc. 
Now, we don't just have cloud services to have our spark cluster there, recently we saw released serverless-spark services.

With all of this background, we reach the point to talk of a data-platform.

A data-platform is a new layer on the stack that uses to be at the top of 1-many clood provider(s) to 
build a data solution. Providing in a friendly-user way the option to create processes without worry about infrastructure and 
sometimes, technology aspects like: coding, development, orchestration, data management, etc.

Example: Qubole (<https://www.qubole.com/>)

## Activity
- Research about data platform. Which one looks more interesting for you?
- Think on a big company (ie. Netflix), research which is the platform (if any) they're currently using.

#  Accessibility # 
Web accessibility refers to tools and technologies designed so that people with disabilities can use them. 
It provides the user a good way to navigate and interact with our website.
Accessibility can be achieved by: 
1.- Using semantic HTML: This gives context to screen readers. Using: `      <form>   <table>    <article>  `
we define the content of the html element of our website. 
2.- Heading should be used correctly `<h1>` should be used for main heading, followed by `<h2>` and so on. 
3.- `alt` text provides an alternativo for an image in case the user for some reason cannot view it(slow connection, errors in the src atributo or the user uses a screen reader). 
4.- Clear language: 
We should always use clear language. Keep senteces as short as possible, avoid dashes, avoid abbreviatoins or slang words.

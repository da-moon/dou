## Presentation:
The purpose of this section is to to break the ice within the candidate and the interviewers and know more about why candidate is here and if he can fit in this program based on his experience and work.

This step it is split in the next steps:

2. After explaining that the main interviewer start to presenting himself, explaining his experience within DevOps and Within de company.
3. Main interviewer will introduce the next interview we and he needs to follow the same presentation.
4. After finish introducing all the interviewers it is time for the candidate to present himself following the same strategy (It is important to ask in between in case we have some doubts about his experience or want to lear more about something).

After following the below steps, we can move now the next section Hard skill "Tech interview".

## Hard skill "Tech interview":
The main reason of this section is to ensure that the candidate will be able to finish the training in a successful way, so we need to ensure the he has strong tech bases to start.
Please remember that we need to ask based on the candidate experience and in the CV. **We ARE NOT expecting an expert**, we are expecting someone that could be, with our help, an expert.

This step it is split in 3 main topics (expected) please follow the links below to check some common questions based on each topic:
- **[Linux](https://github.com/DigitalOnUs/devops_interviews/blob/master/devops-university/linux/linux-questions.md)**

After finishing the 3 main topics, we can go with the DevOps specific topics (desired). These topics are not common to have, but if the candidate have it is a pretty good skill. so we need to ask them based on the previus experience:

## Soft skills: English talking:
In this part we want to ensure the level of spoken english the candidate has, starting with some easy questions and then moving into more complex ones.
This part it is not technical at all, is more about soft skills.

- Question examples:
    + Which are you complete name?
    + What hobbies do you have?
    + Can you tell me about where did you study english?
    + Where do you live?
    + What are your actual plans and a your future plans?
    + Why do you like to be part of this program?

## Soft skill: "Real case scenarios"/English part:
With this topic we want to ensure that the candidate will be able to handle the type of work we do have here and also that he will fit the company culture.
There are no good or bad answers in here, we need to focus on the context and justification of it.
Also we do want here to check the level of english the candidate has (so he can be able to handle this kins od scenarios with the client in real time.)

- Questions examples:
    + Let's say that you are part of a DevOps team in which you are the jr, there is a Sr and there is the manager. The Sr. engineer takes vacations and in that time the client comes totally angry at you and says that the application (which the Sr. has developed) is failing, what do you do?
    + Let's say you are the expert of certain tool and a partener (inside DoU) comes at you looking for some help BUT you are totally busy, what do you do?
    + Let's say that you release a bug in production and the client contact you to blame you about, what do you do?


## Questions and Answers:
This is the last section of the interview in which we want to solve all the questions and doubts that the candidate may have.

So we ask them kindly that we are here to solve any of the question he may have and in case he does not have any of them we can processed to finish the interview.

To finish the interview it is always good, again, say thank you to the candidate and tell him that we will be sharing our feedback to HR team and they will be contacting him shortly, with this we gave him some certainty that the process is on going and it will be fast, we need to avoid that he may go to another interview or taking other opportunities.

Feedback template

Something like this could be useful ðŸ˜„

A few notes:

Whenever you see [OPTION 1 | OPTION 2 | OPTION 3], remember to select just one and remove the rest. For instance: => JAVA: [EXCELLENT]
[STRONG NO | NO | YES | STRONG YES] selection must match the feedback submission on Greenhouse
Remember the more feedback you provide, the easier is for TA to juggle resources amongst positions. For instance, a resource could have flunked on a SDET Mobile interview, but could have very good skills as a SDET BE. That information would be really useful for TA.
Copy below:

=> RECOMMENDATION: [DEFINITELY NO | NO | YES | STRONG YES]

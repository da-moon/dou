# CSS BASICS # 
## FLOAT ## 
Float is used for positioning and formatting content. 
It can have one of the following values: 
1. left - The element floats to the left of its container
2. right - The element floats to the right of its container
3. none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default
4. inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent
## DISPLAY ## 
The display property specifies the display behavior (the type of rendering box) of an element.

# Visualization

We've reached to the last part of our data-workflow, that's basically where our produced data is used by other teams/people.

Most of the DE projects ends with the creation of a data-lake and/or data-warehouses.

These items are used by ML, DA, DS and many other teams for different reasons: ML models, reporting, dashboards, etc.

At the end, we're working with data to find insights, every single stored data must have a meaning. 

That meaning of the data is used to comunicate facts and take decisions based on that. 

Therefore, the way how to visualize it, will be the end of our scope as data-engineers (most of the times, this part is taken by DA and/or equivalent).

Reports and dashboards are mostly the ways how we usually visualize data. Example: monthly sales report, dynamic chart of active users, etc.

Technologies like PowerBi, Tableau, Looker QLink are the technologies for this part of the process.

## Activity

- Navigate to Kaggle, download some interesting dataset and load it into BigQuery table. Uee Looker to visualize some interesting metrics from there.
- Any integration you might think we can use to make it better?

  * Understand the type of interview (Check next slide).​
  * Be realistic!: We cannot be expert in all the topics, so in case you do not feel comfortable with some of the main topics, ask HR team to give you some help asking another DevOps engineer inside the practice that can complement yourself.​
  * Study the candidate: Go to Resumé and review the candidate's experience focusing on the qualifications for the position. 
* Prepare your questions and real case scenarios according with the position’s qualifications and seniority level. You can always go to our DevOps interview topics. (https://github.com/DigitalOnUs/devops_interviews#devops-questionnaire-s) to have ideas about the questions you can make based on the level that is expected.​

## TYPES OF INTERVIEWS <a name="interviewtypes"></a>

Normally we interview within these two main DevOps areas:​:

* **DevOps Engineer**: Please remember that DevOps is a pretty complex world and this is only like an overview advance, but always ALWAYS review the position and ask HR team or DM for more guidance.​
  * Mid DevOps Engineer (2-3 years of experience in the main tools). Able to understand basic concepts, applied experience and at least one tool per topic (one CI/CD, one container, etc)​.
  * Sr. DevOps Engineer (3-5 years of experience in the main tools). Able to understand advance concepts and the ability to provide solutions without a guidance​.
  * Cloud Engineer (2-3 years in clouds technologies and able to troubleshoot networking). Able to work across many of the cloud services and debugging them:
    1. GCP
    2. AWS
    3. Azure

---
* **SRE (site reliability engineer)**: Please remember that, by default, and SRE must be a SR. Engineer.​
  * Understand SRE concepts (SLA, SLO, Toil, etc)​.
  * Confident working with client face-to-face.​
  * Able to solve problems in production scenarios.​
  * Good scripting knowledge.​
  * Prove documentation skills and able to understand the complete CI/CD process and architecture of an app.

> It's highly recommended to sweep the candidate with all questions. This way:
> <br/>* Your feedback will be more accurate and rich
> <br/>* On your feedback _(public notes)_, you could easily identify whether the candidate is good for a different type of position

## DevOps INTERVIEW TIPS & FLOW (During the interview) <a name="flow"></a>

###### **_`Every interviewer, will tackle interviews differently and it's VALID!`_**

Still, take into account the following tips for a better experience:
1. Greet the candidate kindly 
    1. Remove all the tension and make them feel comfortable
1. Ask the candidate to turn her/his camera on as well **_(is a must)_**, in case the candidate is not able, please re-schedule the meeting.​
1. Introduce yourself, name and role in the company will suffice 
1. Explain at a very high level the tech-interview process that the candidate will go through
    1. Depending on the job description and if its SRE or only DevOps, so please be clear on that.
1. **_Here's a good time to ask the candidate to switch to English, if you haven't done so_**
1. Move ahead with technical questions, please do not forget the main topics, here in devops we will need a pretty complex stack, so focus on the priority ones.
1. Do wait max 30 seconds for an answer, if there is no answer you can try:​
  * Asking the question in a different way​.
  * Giving an example​.
  * Changing the question​.
1. Many people study only the concept to pass the interview, focus on both: concept and experience.
1. Please take some time to ask about real case scenarios where the mos important thing are the softskills, remember that at the end of the day the candidate should fit the company spirit and the practice flow. Take some examples from here: **[SoftSkills Questions](https://github.com/DigitalOnUs/devops_interviews/blob/master/topics/softskills/questions.md)**
1. Fill out candidate scorecard _([read below](#gh))_

# Vault KVCTL Tool

This tool places a secret entry in the destination folder at `._kvctl`. It is
used for the generation of reporting data, to ensure that the tool has been run
successfully. You should not delete or modify the secret entry for any reason;
instead, the Vault team will delete this entry once it is no longer needed.

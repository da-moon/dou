# Sprint 0 ⚡️

## Purpose 🤓
This sprint focuses on preparing the work environment and the most essential tools that the entire program will work on, understanding how Git works, Githooks, creating basic bash scripts on Linux and creating VMs using Vagrant, and the introduction to the sample app with which you will work throughout the project and how we need to organize the Git workspace.

## Tools you will learn: 🛠

### Git:
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

### Githooks:
Git hooks are a way to automatically run a command when a certain event happens in your Git repository.

### Linux:
Linux is a Unix-like operating system designed for computers.

Linux has been around since the mid-1990s and has since reached a user-base that spans the globe. Linux is actually everywhere: It’s in your phones, your thermostats, in your cars, refrigerators, Roku devices, and televisions. It also runs most of the Internet, all of the world’s top 500 supercomputers, and the world’s stock exchanges.

But besides being the platform of choice to run desktops, servers, and embedded systems across the globe, Linux is one of the most reliable, secure and worry-free operating systems available.

### Vagrant:
Vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machines.

HashiCorp Vagrant provides the same, easy workflow regardless of your role as a developer, operator, or designer. It leverages a declarative configuration file which describes all your software requirements, packages, operating system configuration, users, and more.

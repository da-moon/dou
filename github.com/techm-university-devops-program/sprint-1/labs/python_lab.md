# 1. Python Environment (Virtualenv)

### Objective
Understand the ways to isolate your local python environment, the classic way is to use
Virtualenv, or in other cases create a docker container with your dependencies

### Instructions

- Install Python 3+ and pip if missing
- Install virtual env : pip3 install virtualenv.
- Create two virtual env with different versions of the same package (that's the most common use case
where you have an special version that cannot update) 
- Freeze python requirements
- install from a requirements file
- Bonus: In case the student is super advanced explain what would be the difference of doing this vs using a docker container, and what could be the limitations. 

# 2. Python basics

### Objective
Understand minimun statements that make possible to create basic scripts in python, be able to create programs that responds to different input data

### Instructions

create a python function that calculates fibonacci nth number.
Create a python script that could be executed in the terminal, the script will accept a path as first parameter printing a list of files on that directory.

# 3. Python objects (mutable/inmutable) and built-in types (tuples, lists, dictionaries)

### Objective
Understand the difference between an object and a variable in python, as well as some of the most common objects and start working with common Built-in types.

### Instructions
- Explain an easy way to understand the difference between objects and variables (example in console is a must).
- Provide 1 example of, at least 6 different Built-in types in python.
- Show with an example how can you determine that an object is mutable and when an object it is not (console is a must).
- Apply and explain at least 3 different attributes of the 6 different Built-in types mentioned below.


# 4. Unit testing

### Objective
Be able to create a unit test module in python using unittest.

### Instructions
- Create at least 5 unit tests based on any code you want.
- At least one of the unit test should have positive and negative case scenario.

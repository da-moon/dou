# Sprint 3 ⚡️

## Purpose 🤓
You will begin to understand how IaC works through Terraform, as well as provisioning it with Configuration Management through Ansible and how this provisioning can be integrated with CI/CD and with tools like Packer, to be able to provision automatically.

## Tools you will learn: 🛠

### Terraform:
Terraform is a tool for building, configuring, and managing infrastructure as code. It is a declarative language that can be used to describe a set of resources in a way that can be rendered as a collection of Terraform code.

> For more information, visit [Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/).

### Ansible:
Ansible is an open source IT automation engine that automates provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, orchestration, and many other IT processes.

Use Ansible automation to install software, automate daily tasks, provision infrastructure, improve security and compliance, patch systems, and share automation across your organization.

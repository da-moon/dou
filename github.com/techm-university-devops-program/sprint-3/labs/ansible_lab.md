# Ansible Lab ðŸŽ›

# 1. Working with adhoc commands

### Instructions

- Create a adhoc command that display the **first 10 users located in /etc/passwd.** Use only adhoc command, find the way to pass parameters for the module used.

This adhoc command must be applied for all of your vms listed in your inventory file.

# 2. Working with loops and systemd module 

### Instructions
- You must provisioning a new server. Requiered packages to install in
all nodes:
  - cups
  - vim
  - httpd
  - gcc

- Enable and start the service of httpd and cups, using the correct module for your distribution (service or systemd).

- Create playbook that install all of those packages using loops and
the system configuration also must be done using loops.

# 3. Using ansible Roles

An ansible role, is a way to modularize ansible playbooks.

It is also a way to reuse ansible playbooks, and collaborate with the community.

More info [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html)

### Examples
This [github repo](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-examples) written by ansible has many playbook examples that use roles.

However, they are written for outdated CentOS versions. I tried to use the `wordpress with nginx` example and got some errors.

Still, they are useful so you can see examples of the file structure and use cases.


## Instructions

1. On your local computer run the following command to create the basic template of a role. (It will create a directory with the file structure of an ansible role)

> ansible-galaxy init apache --offline

2. Replace the `tasks/main.yml` file with the following:

        ---
        - name: Install httpd Package
        yum: name=httpd state=latest
        - name: Copy index.html file
        copy: src=files/index.html dest=/var/www/html
        notify:
        - restart apache
        - name: Start and Enable httpd service
        service: name=httpd state=restarted enabled=yes

3. Create a `index.html` file inside the `files/` directory with the following content or with something that you like to have a welcome message:

        You have created a web server using an Ansible Role! Yay!

4. Replace the `handlers/main.yml' file with the following: 

        ---
        - name: restart apache
        service: name=httpd state=restarted

5. Edit the `meta/main.yml' file to write your metadata

        author: 
        description: 
        company: 
    
6. Create a CentOS VM in Azure.

Remember to allocate a public IP for the VM, and open the ports [22, 80].

Make sure that your public SSH key is authorized by the VM.

7. Create an inventory file that includes the public IP of your newly created VM.

`inventory.ini`

        [VM]
        104.236.60.139  # replace this

8. Create a playbook file that will call the role

`role_playbook.yml` 

        --
        - name: Install Apache
        hosts: all
        remote_user: root

        roles:
            - apache

9. Organize your files

Where the `role_playbook.yml`, there should be a directory called `roles/`

Be sure to move the `apache` directory inside the `roles` directory

10. Run your playbook

> ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini role_playbook.yml

![](/extra-docs/img/role_play_recap.png)

11. Visit your new website.

It should be the same IP as in the inventory.

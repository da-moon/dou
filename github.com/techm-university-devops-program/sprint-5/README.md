# Sprint 5 ⚡️

## Purpose 🤓
Finally, you will understand the concepts of DevSecOps through Hashicorp Vault, setting up a Vault agent with Terraform and Ansible (Packer, GitHub Actions) for the protection of secrets to integrate them into your CI/CD pipeline. Finally, you must present your project in front of a panel explaining the reason for your solution.

### Tools you will use 🛠:

### Vault:
HashiCorp Vault is a secrets management tool specifically designed to control access to sensitive credentials in a low-trust environment. It can be used to store sensitive values and at the same time dynamically generate access for specific services/applications on lease. Plus, Vault can be used to authenticate users (machines or humans) to make sure they’re authorized to access a particular file.

HashiCorp Vault can be used to store any type of secrets, including sensitive environment variables, database credentials, API keys, and more, giving users control over who has access and who does not. Using Vault allows you to take full control of any sensitive credentials with the ability to rotate and revoke access at any time.

With HashiCorp Vault, you can rest assured that your credentials are secure, compared to storing plaintext files in your configuration management (for example).

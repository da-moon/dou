# FEATURE REQUEST

## Description of Request

- Setup a role that stores required artifacts and prepares the operating system
for running Vault

## Reason or Need for Feature

- To ensure minimal configuration drift, we try to include as much
configuration artifacts as possible inside the golden image

## Design / Proposal / Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create `vault` system user and group and ensure it does not have a shell so
no human entity can login as `vault`
- [ ] Vault Data Directory
  - Location : `/var/vault/data`
  - Ownership : `vault` user/group.
  - Stores Raft HA storage data after Vault starts
- [ ] Static Vault Configuration directory:
  - Location : `/etc/vault.d`
  - Ownership : `vault` user/group.
  - Include any 'static' (not-templated) Vault configuration artifacts.
  - Files:
    - [`/etc/vault.d/listener.hcl`][listener-tcp]:  stores configuration for
    setting up Vault TLS listener.
    - [`/etc/vault.d/telemetry.hcl`][telemetry-prometheus]:  stores
    configuration that tells Vault to export metrics in `Prometheus` format.
    - [`/etc/vault.d/replication.hcl`][config-replication]:  stores
    configuration parameters for tuning replication related values.
- [ ] Templated Vault Configuration Directory :
  - Location: `/var/vault.d`
  - Ownership : `vault` user/group.
  - Include templated configuration artifacts; i.e artifacts that require
  values that are only known after a VM is created based off of this golden
  image, such as Cluster node IP addresses
  - Templated artifacts have `tmpl` extension; e.g `/var/vault.d/foo.hcl.tmpl`
  - Files:
    - [`/var/vault.d/seal.hcl.tmpl`][azurekeyvault-seal]: Stores templated
    config for auto unseal with Azure Key Vault
    - [`/var/vault.d/raft.hcl.tmpl`][storage-raft]: Stores templated config
    file for using built in Raft HA storage.
    - `/var/vault.d/config-root.hcl.tmpl`: Stores configuration directives that
    do not belong to any stanzas such as `ui`
- [ ] Vault Server TLS certificates
  - Location: `/etc/vault.d/tls`
  - Ownership : `vault` user/group.
- [ ] Script that renders templated Vault configuration artifacts :
  - Location: `/usr/local/bin/render-vault-config`
  - Must be executable
  - This script would use `envsubst` to render templated configuration
  artifacts under `/var/vault.d` and store the final result in `/etc/vault.d/`
  - After rendering templates, The following must exist in Vault config
  directory
    - `/etc/vault.d/listener.hcl`
    - `/etc/vault.d/telemetry.hcl`
    - `/etc/vault.d/replication.hcl`
    - `/etc/vault.d/seal.hcl`
    - `/etc/vault.d/raft.hcl`
    - `/etc/vault.d/config-root.hcl`
- [ ] Vault Certificate init script
  - Location: `/usr/local/bin/init-vault-tls`
  - Must be executable
  - This script would pull CA and tls key-pair from a trusted source and stored
  them in `/etc/vault.d/certificates`
  - After pulling the certificates, the following files must be created
    - `/etc/vault.d/tls/ca.pem`
    - `/etc/vault.d/tls/cert.pem`
    - `/etc/vault.d/tls/key.pem`
- [ ] Vault DR cluster setup script
  - Location: `/usr/local/bin/vault-dr-cluster-setup`
  - Ownership : `vault` user/group.
  - This script runs after Vault daemon starts and sets up Vault DR cluster
- [ ] Use `SystemD` to manage Vault daemon:
  - Hardened unit file:
    - Prevent Privilege escalation
    - Disable swap
  - Uses `vault` system user/group
  - Uses `ExecStartPre` directive to run `/usr/local/bin/init-vault-tls` before
  running `vault`
  - Uses `ExecStartPre` directive to run `/usr/local/bin/render-vault-config`
  before running `vault`
  - Uses `ExecStartPost` to run `/usr/local/bin/vault-dr-cluster-setup` script
  after starting `vault`
  - Ensure that it is **enabled** ( not **started** )
- [ ] [`Splunk`][splunk-journald] configuration to read logs from `journald`
- [ ] Document What is the purpose of this role in `ansible/README.md` file.

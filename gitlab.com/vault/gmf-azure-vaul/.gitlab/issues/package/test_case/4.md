# Test Case

## Summary

This test is to ensure that `IPtables` is not blocking any required port in the
golden image as ingress/egress traffic should be managed through Azure security
groups

## Steps

- update the `gossfile` in `goss` role, under `ansible/roles/goss` and add necessary rules to ensure:
  - The following ports are open they should be open: `22`, `8200`, `8201`
  - All other ports must be blocked
- Run the build and include a link to the successful run of the pipeline

## Acceptance Criteria

- The build must be successful
  - `goss` should not complain

# Hi friend! ✋

In this directory you will be able to find resources that you need such as presentations, readmes, links and guides of the topics that the trainees are studying to help you help them! 🚀

You can browse the folders in this directory to help you in your sessions depending on the topic you are assigned to, as well as you can help us by collaborating with new material that you think might be helpful! 🙌

You can find the instructions [here](/mentor-resources/collaborate.md) 🤓

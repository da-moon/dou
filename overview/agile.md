# Agile üèÉ

Agile Methodology is a people-focused, results-focused approach to software development that respects our rapidly changing world. It‚Äôs centered around adaptive planning, self-organization, and short delivery times. It‚Äôs flexible, fast, and aims for continuous improvements in quality, using tools like Scrum and eXtreme Programming. 

## How It Works
It works by first admitting that the old ‚Äúwaterfall‚Äù method of software development leaves a lot to be desired. The process of ‚Äúplan, design, build, test, deliver,‚Äù works okay for making cars or buildings but not as well for creating software systems. In a business environment where hardware, demand, and competition are all swiftly-changing variables, agile works by walking the fine line between too much process and not enough.

## Agile Methodology Overview
It abandons the risk of spending months or years on a process that ultimately fails because of some small mistake in an early phase. It relies instead on trusting employees and teams to work directly with customers to understand the goals and provide solutions in a fast and incremental way.

- Faster, smaller. 
	- Traditional software development relied on phases like outlining the requirements, planning, design, building, testing, and delivery. Agile methodology, by contrast, looks to deploy the first increment in a couple weeks and the entire piece of software in a couple months.
- Communication. 
	- Agile teams within the business work together daily at every stage of the project through face-to-face meetings. This collaboration and communication ensure the process stays on track even as conditions change.
- Feedback. 
	- Rather than waiting until the delivery phase to gauge success, teams leveraging Agile methodology track the success and speed of the development process regularly. Velocity is measured after the delivery of each increment.
- Trust. 
	- Agile teams and employees are self-organizing. Rather than following a manifesto of rules from management intended to produce the desired result, they understand the goals and create their own path to reach them.
- Adjust. 
	- Participants tune and adjust the process continually, following the KIS or Keep It Simple principle.

## Examples of Agile Methodology
The most popular and common examples are Scrum, eXtreme Programming (XP), Feature Driven Development (FDD), Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM), Adaptive Software Development (ASD), Crystal, and Lean Software Development (LSD). Teams generally pick one or two methods. The most widely used methodologies are Scrum and XP, which dovetail nicely.

### Scrum is a hands-on system consisting of simple interlocking steps and components:

A product owner makes a prioritized wish list known as a product backlog.
The scrum team takes one small piece of the top of the wish list called a sprint backlog and plans to implement it.
The team completes their sprint backlog task in a sprint (a 2-4 week period). They assess progress in a meeting called a daily scrum.
The ScrumMaster keeps the team focused on the goal.
At the sprint‚Äôs end, the work is ready to ship or show. The team closes the sprint with a review, then starts a new sprint.
Here‚Äôs an example of how Scrum works: Bill meets with a customer to discuss her company‚Äôs needs. Those needs are the product backlog. Bill chooses the most important tasks to work on in the next two weeks. His team meets in a daily scrum to target work for the day ahead and address roadblocks. At the end of the sprint, Bill delivers the work, reviews the backlog, and sets the goal for the next sprint. The cycle repeats until the software is complete.

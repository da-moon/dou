# What is configuration management? ðŸŽ›

Configuration management is a systems engineering process for establishing consistency of a productâ€™s attributes throughout its life. In the technology world, configuration management is an IT management process that tracks individual configuration items of an IT system. IT systems are composed of IT assets that vary in granularity. An IT asset may represent a piece of software, or a server, or a cluster of servers. The following focuses on configuration management as it directly applies to IT software assets and software asset CI/CD.

Software configuration management is a systems engineering process that tracks and monitors changes to a software systems configuration metadata. In software development, configuration management is commonly used alongside version control and CI/CD infrastructure. This post focuses on its modern application and use in agile CI/CD software environments.

## Configuration management benefits
Think of it like this. If you keep up with the small things, you can avoid more complicated, expensive repairs in the future. Configuration management is about preventing issues so you donâ€™t have to deal with as many problems later. 

For example, you can make sure that your test and production environments match. That way, youâ€™ll have fewer problems with applications once theyâ€™ve been deployed than you would if these environments werenâ€™t exactly the same.

With configuration management, you can accurately replicate an environment with the correct configurations and software because you know what exists in the original environment.

## Configuration management with Ansible

Ansible is a radically simple IT automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, intra-service orchestration, and many other IT needs.

Designed for multi-tier deployments since day one, Ansible models your IT infrastructure by describing how all of your systems inter-relate, rather than just managing one system at a time.

It uses no agents and no additional custom security infrastructure, so it's easy to deploy - and most importantly, it uses a very simple language (YAML, in the form of Ansible Playbooks) that allow you to describe your automation jobs.

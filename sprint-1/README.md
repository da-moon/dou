# Sprint 1 ⚡️

## Purpose 🤓
You will have to learn to handle python scripting, debugging ready-made scripts as well as creating them from scratch and creating unit tests. Understand the basics of Docker, including the differences between containers and VMs, migrating apps to Docker, building the python services in Dockerfiles, and a basic understanding of Docker Compose.

## Tools you will learn: 🛠

### Python:
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

### Docker:
The word "Docker" refers to several things, including an open source community project; tools from the open source project; Docker Inc., the company that primarily supports that project; and the tools that company formally supports. The fact that the technologies and the company share the same name can be confusing.

Here's a brief explainer:

The IT software "Docker” is containerization technology that enables the creation and use of Linux® containers.
The open source Docker community works to improve these technologies to benefit all users.
The company, Docker Inc., builds on the work of the Docker community, makes it more secure, and shares those advancements back to the greater community. It then supports the improved and hardened technologies for enterprise customers.
With Docker, you can treat containers like extremely lightweight, modular virtual machines. And you get flexibility with those containers&mdash;you can create, deploy, copy, and move them from environment to environment, which helps optimize your apps for the cloud.

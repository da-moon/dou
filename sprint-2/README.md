# Sprint 2 ⚡️

## Purpose 🤓
The main function of this Sprint will focus on creating and understanding CI/CD pipelines, understanding why they are used and creating a simple pipeline with docker images building, as well as running unit tests and making use of githooks. At the same time, knowledge about the services available in the cloud and how they work with each other will be introduced in a deeper way.

## Tools you will learn: 🛠

### Github Actions:
GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. You can create workflows that build and test every pull request to your repository, or deploy merged pull requests to production.

GitHub Actions goes beyond just DevOps and lets you run workflows when other events happen in your repository. For example, you can run a workflow to automatically add the appropriate labels whenever someone creates a new issue in your repository.

### Cloud Overview (AWS, GCP, Azure):
The cloud is made up of servers in data centers all over the world. Moving to the cloud can save companies money and add convenience for users.

"The cloud" refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. Cloud servers are located in data centers all over the world. By using cloud computing, users and companies do not have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machines.

You will learn the basic concepts of cloud computing and the most common cloud services available in the most used cloud providers.

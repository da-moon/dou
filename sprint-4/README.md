# Sprint 4 ⚡️

## Purpose 🤓
For this sprint, the main idea is to concretize knowledge in CI/CD, and micro-services, to achieve it: you will use your CI/CD pipeline to push the images they built to a container registry. Understand Kubernetes architecture, basic concepts, and deployment of your sample app to a cluster. The deployment of the sample app images must be carried out using Helm, so it will be essential to acquire knowledge about this tool.

## Tools you will learn 🛠:

### Kubernetes:
Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

The name Kubernetes originates from Greek, meaning helmsman or pilot. K8s as an abbreviation results from counting the eight letters between the "K" and the "s". Google open-sourced the Kubernetes project in 2014. Kubernetes combines over 15 years of Google's experience running production workloads at scale with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

### Helm:
Helm is a Kubernetes deployment tool for automating creation, packaging, configuration, and deployment of applications and services to Kubernetes clusters.

If Kubernetes were an operating system, Helm would be the package manager. Ubuntu uses apt, CentOS uses yum, and Kubernetes uses helm.

Helm deploys packaged applications to Kubernetes and structures them into charts. The charts contain all pre-configured application resources along with all the versions into one easily manageable package.

Helm streamlines installing, upgrading, fetching dependencies, and configuring deployments on Kubernetes with simple CLI commands. Software packages are found in repositories or are created.

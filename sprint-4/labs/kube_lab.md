# 1. Kubernetes exercise

### Instructions

Deploy the following in your AKS (Azure Kubernetes Service):

1. An nginx ingress controller that through the path /config /secret redirects you to a deployment where 2 pods are deployed with the image of ```gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:1.0 ``` and makes use of a configmap (only configure an environment variable with a value taken from a configmap) and another deployment the same but consumes the data from a secret. (The /config redirect to the deployment with the configmap and the /secret to the deployment with the secret).


2. Deploy a kustomization that takes as resources everything deployed in point 1 but changes the google image tag to version 2 (```gcr.io/google-samples/hello-app:2.0```).


3. Replicate the horizontal auto scaling experiment seen in the class where with 20% of averageUtilization scale up to 5 pods. 
Can use the [traffic generator script](/sprint-4/kubernetes_extras/traffic-generator.sh)
